Tiny Bluetooth Library
=============

This project aims to create Bluetooth GATT bindings for C++, Java and other
languages, using BlueZ over DBus. Most of the code is automatically
generated using gdbus-codegen, including a few additions to the default
behaviour, such that it also generates the C++ classes, which wrap the functions
normally generated by gdbus-codegen.

Using TinyB
============

TinyB requires CMake 3.1+ for building and requires GLib/GIO 2+. It also requires BlueZ with GATT profile activated, which is currently experimental (as of BlueZ 5.37), so you might have to run bluetoothd with the -E flag. For example, on a system with systemd (Fedora, poky, etc.) edit the bluetooth.service file (usually found in /usr/lib/systemd/system/ or /lib/systemd/system) and append -E to ExecStart line, restart the daemon with systemctl restart bluetooth.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last command will create the include/ and lib/ directories with a copy of
the headers and library objects respectively in your build location. Note that
doing an out-of-source build may cause issues when rebuilding later on.

Our cmake configure has a number of options, *cmake-gui* or *ccmake* can show
you all the options. The interesting ones are detailed below:

Changing install path from /usr/local to /usr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building debug build:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using clang instead of gcc:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cross-compiling on a different system:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-m32 -march=i586
-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-m32 -march=i586
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build Java bindings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DBUILDJAVA=ON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build documentation run: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
make doc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hellotinyb example uses a [TI Sensor Tag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/?INTC=SensorTag&HQS=sensortag) from which it reads the ambient temperature. You have to pass the MAC address of the Sensor Tag as a first parameter to the program.
